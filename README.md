# BankApp
Dynamic Web Application (Java, Servlets and JSPs, Multi-Threading)

This test application is meant to be used by bank employees. There are options for opening new accounts, transfers between different accounts, searching transaction history, interest withholding and etc.

The database is intentionally simplified, the point of the app is excercising servlets and jsps.

Threre are two versions. In BankAppWeb scriplets are used in the jsps. In BankAppUpgrade all the logic is in the Servlets, jsps only display information. The SQL for the database, together with some test data, is in bankappDB.sql.

First page of both versions is Login.jsp
